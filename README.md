## üåç Why FarmSight?

> Despite facing the worst climate impacts, many African farmers lack access to timely, localized climate information. Existing platforms are either too complex, too expensive, or not built for smallholders. FarmSight closes this gap by turning raw satellite data into simple, actionable insights ‚Äî accessible from any device.
